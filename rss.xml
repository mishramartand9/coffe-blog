&lt;p&gt;The timeless verse of the Chef Ranveer Brar üôè &quot;Ye v India ki nhi hai&quot; holds true for Coffee also. However for coffee we at least know Baba Budan is to be thanked for blessing us with the joy of brewed delicacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here&apos;s a short note from Wikipedia on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_India&quot;&gt;Coffee Production in India&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Indian context, coffee growing started with an Indian Muslim saint, Baba Budan,[2][8] who, while returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca, smuggled seven coffee beans (by hiding them in his beard) from Yemen to Mysore in India.[7] He planted them on the Chandra Drona Giri (1,829 metres (6,001 ft))(&apos;Giri&apos; means &quot;hill&quot;) in Chikkamagaluru district. It was considered an illegal act to take out green coffee seed out of Arabia. As number seven is a sacrosanct number in Islamic religion, the saint&apos;s act of carrying seven coffee beans was considered a religious act&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A religious act indeed !!! my wallet could never afford imported Ethiopian Yirgacheffe had he not smuggled the seven little beans of joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough on the origins of coffee in India now it is time to delve into why I willingly put so much effort into perfecting this psychoactive brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well on a fine Winter afternoon a couple of years back I was strolling across the isles of a retail store when I came across a black packet of freshly put instant Coffee, I was reading through the back label when I saw the magical lines &quot;Research has shown coffee reduces the risk of Alzheimer&apos;s disease&quot;. I was shell shocked; the disease I dread most, the Voldemort of the diseases and I can reduce the risk with just a cup of coffee. Why not??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I instantly purchased the pack of instant coffee. I had tasted coffee earlier, however all those earlier instances involved copious amount of sugar in a cup of milk and cautious addition of half a spoon of coffee to ensure the concoction never ever turns bitter. No playing around with the amount of sugar at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no fooling around the fact the more I am aging quirkier I am becoming. At the point when I decided to try black coffee I had already decided to reduce the amount of crystal sugar and my divorce with milk in its pure liquid form was already formalized. Hence I did what I could I dissolved a spoon of that brown instant coffee into hot unsweetened water. I knew the stuff would not taste great but never knew it would be stuff of nightmares !!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the period I tried to vary the ratio of that bitter brown powder and the hot water and even the temperature of the water, frankly nothing worked. To put it politely may be I am over sensitive to the bitter taste. I had decided to call quits on coffee when Youtube recommended a video of his holiness üôè Shree Shree 108 the Barista of Baristas Mr James Hoffman. He was describing brewed coffee as sweet. I thought maybe this instant coffee is the &quot;goldana chai&quot; scam of the coffee world, maybe I need the brewed coffee. And friend that is &quot;How I met brewed coffee&quot;. The decision to pursue the brewed coffee took me down the rabbit hole which finally materialized into this tell all series. I hope some of the future blogs will have some stuff which may help you with your own journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
