It was considered an illegal act to take out green coffee seed out of Arabia. As number seven is a sacrosanct number in Islamic religion, the saint's act of carrying seven coffee beans was considered a religious act</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2689f2a2da0183f9b604e9d6d65c8557/c08c5/blog-icon.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 49.36708860759494%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Coffee\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/2689f2a2da0183f9b604e9d6d65c8557/828fb/blog-icon.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2689f2a2da0183f9b604e9d6d65c8557/ff44c/blog-icon.jpg 158w,\n/static/2689f2a2da0183f9b604e9d6d65c8557/a6688/blog-icon.jpg 315w,\n/static/2689f2a2da0183f9b604e9d6d65c8557/828fb/blog-icon.jpg 630w,\n/static/2689f2a2da0183f9b604e9d6d65c8557/c08c5/blog-icon.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>A religious act indeed !!! my wallet could never afford imported Ethiopian Yirgacheffe had he not smuggled the seven little beans of joy.</p>\n<p>Enough on the origins of coffee in India now it is time to delve into why I willingly put so much effort into perfecting this psychoactive brew.</p>\n<p>Well on a fine Winter afternoon a couple of years back I was strolling across the isles of a retail store when I came across a black packet of freshly put instant Coffee, I was reading through the back label when I saw the magical lines \"Research has shown coffee reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease\". I was shell shocked; the disease I dread most, the Voldemort of the diseases and I can reduce the risk with just a cup of coffee. Why not??</p>\n<p>I instantly purchased the pack of instant coffee. I had tasted coffee earlier, however all those earlier instances involved copious amount of sugar in a cup of milk and cautious addition of half a spoon of coffee to ensure the concoction never ever turns bitter. No playing around with the amount of sugar at all.</p>\n<p>There is no fooling around the fact the more I am aging quirkier I am becoming. At the point when I decided to try black coffee I had already decided to reduce the amount of crystal sugar and my divorce with milk in its pure liquid form was already formalized. Hence I did what I could, I dissolved a spoon of that brown instant coffee into hot unsweetened water. I knew the stuff would not taste great but never knew it would be stuff of nightmares !!!</p>\n<p>Over the period I tried to vary the ratio of that bitter brown powder and the hot water and even the temperature of the water, frankly nothing worked. To put it politely may be I am over sensitive to the bitter taste. I had decided to call quits on coffee when Youtube recommended a video of his holiness üôè Shree Shree 108 the Barista of Baristas Mr James Hoffman. He was describing brewed coffee as sweet. I thought maybe this instant coffee is the \"goldana chai\" scam of the coffee world, maybe I need the brewed coffee. And friend that is \"How I met brewed coffee\". The decision to pursue the brewed coffee took me down the rabbit hole which finally materialized into this tell all series. I hope some of the future blogs will have some stuff which may help you with your own journey.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"And then there was Coffee","date":"January 17, 2023","description":"Start of the affair"}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/liquid-desert/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cappuccino: The liquid dessert"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a8c749b1-a19c-5d31-bf1a-5caa3bb71adb","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"2b0cb7e0-bbb0-5286-87d7-35567d22bf2f"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3274528899"],"slicesMap":{}}
